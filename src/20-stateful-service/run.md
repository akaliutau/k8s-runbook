# Stateful Service

# Description

In a stateful application, every instance is unique and knows its own identity, 
and the main ingredients of that identity are the long-lived storage and the networking coordinates.

StatefulSet is designed for managing non-fungible Pods, as opposed to ReplicaSet, which is for managing identical replaceable Pods.

Networking:

Each Pod will get a DNS entry where clients can directly reach out to it in a predictable way. 
For example, if app has a name `app`, we can reach our `app-0` Pod through its fully qualified domain name: 
`app-0.service-name.default.svc.cluster.local` , where the Podâ€™s name is prepended to the Service name.
